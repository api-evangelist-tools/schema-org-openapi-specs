            symbols such as \''$\'' in the value.      Use \''.\'' (Unicode \''FULL

            using these symbols as a readability separator.      Note that both RDFa
            and Microdata syntax allow the use of a \"content=\" attribute for publishing
            simple machine-readable values      alongside more human-friendly formatting.      Use
            values from 0123456789 (Unicode \''DIGIT ZERO\'' (U+0030) to \''DIGIT NINE\''
