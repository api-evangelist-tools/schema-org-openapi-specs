          description: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more
            specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a
            relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa
            syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the \'typeof\' attribute
            - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding
            of extra types, in particular those defined externally.
