    title: Drug Cost API
    description: The cost per unit of a medical drug. Note that this type is not meant
      to represent the price in an offer of a drug for sale; see the Offer type for
      that. This type will typically be used to tag wholesale or average retail cost
      of a drug, or maximum reimbursable cost. Costs of medical drugs vary widely depending
      on how and where they are paid for, so while this type captures some of the variables,
      costs should be used with caution by consumers of this schema\'s markup.
