    Unlike SubscribeAction, FollowAction implies that the follower acts as an active
    agent constantly/actively polling for updates.RegisterAction: Unlike RegisterAction,
    FollowAction implies that the agent is interested in continuing receiving updates
    from the object.JoinAction: Unlike JoinAction, FollowAction implies that the agent
    is interested in getting updates from the object.TrackAction: Unlike TrackAction,
    FollowAction refers to the polling of updates of all aspects of animate objects
    rather than the location of inanimate objects (e.g. you track a package, but you
