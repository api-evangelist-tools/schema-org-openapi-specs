    title: Medical Contraindication API
    description: A condition or factor that serves as a reason to withhold a certain
      medical therapy. Contraindications can be absolute (there are no reasonable circumstances
      for undertaking a course of action) or relative (the patient is at higher risk
      of complications, but that these risks may be outweighed by other considerations
      or mitigated by other measures).
