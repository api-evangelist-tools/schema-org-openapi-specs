    title: Property Value API
    description: 'A property-value pair, e.g. representing a feature of a product or
      place. Use the \''name\'' property for the name of the property. If there is an
      additional human-readable version of the value, put that into the \''description\''
      property. Always use specific schema.org properties when a) they exist and b)
      you can populate them. Using PropertyValue as a substitute will typically not
      trigger the same effect as using the original, specific property. '
