  description: This is my research into how leading API platforms conduct their official
    partner programs, adding additional layers to the API partnerning and management
    process. You can find news I've curated, organizations doing interesting things,
    some of the common building blocks I've identified, and open source tooling in
    this research report.

  description: This is my research into how certification is happening via API driven
    platforms. It could be certification of the platform, or certification of the
    user--if it is about certification I am tracking on it here. You can find news
    I've curated, organizations doing interesting things, some of the common building
    blocks I've identified, and open source tooling in this research report.

  description: As part of my work I keep an eye on some of the acquisitions going
    on that are API related, not because I'm interested in the funding, more about
    the reliability, stability, and viability of individual APIs, as well as the perception
    of the API space.

    consumers. You can find news I've curated, organizations doing interesting things,

  description: I am always interested to see which API providers are proud of their
    developers, and the applications and integrations they have built on top of a
    platform. I find it is a sign, when API stop showcasing their developers and applications,
    of things are not right. This is my research into who is showcasing their devs,
    and how they do it.
