    My API design industry guide, documenting the companies, apis, tools, and
    common building blocks across the API design stop along the API lifecycle.
    API design is much more than just REST, and there is a growing industry
    emerging when it comes to the discipline. My goal is to try and take a
    regular snapshot of my API design research, and publish here as an industry
    guide that people of all skill levels can learn from.

    This is the most important area of my API research. API definitions are
    impacting every stop along the API lifecycle and this my effort to take a
    snapshot of the organizations, apis, tools, and common building blocks in
    play when it comes to defining APIs. This research goes beyone just API
    definitions like OpenAPI, and includes schema, and other standards that are
    being used to define APIs across the spectrum.

    When I first starting doing API Evangelist everything was about management.
    People would ask me which of the API management service provider are going
    to help them deploy their APIs, and I would respond none of them. Times have
    changed, and more of them will help you deploy, as well as manage your APIs,
    but my research continues. This is my API deployment industry guide, helping
    people make sense of what is possible when it comes to deploying APIs in
    2017.

    API management is the oldest area of my research, studying what the
    successful API providers are doing to manage their operations. This is the
    result of my research into the companies, services, tools, APIs, and latest
    news who are catering to what API providers are needing. I work to make it a
    mix of what API service providers are doing, as well as the best practices
    from successful API providers.

  description: >-
    This research started about just determining when web APIs started to
    evolve. Then once I started noticing other trends like social, cloud, and
    mobile, I thought it needed a little more investigation. After first doing
    the research I began adding to it every year, resulting in my ongoing
    history of APIs guide.

  description: >-
    I look at a lot of pricing and plan pages for APIs. As I was doing my
    research into the common approaches to API plans I thought it would be
    useful to share some of the leading examples of these pages, to help act as
    a sort of design guide for API plan pages. Eventually this guid will evolve
    beyond just the screenshots, and actually provide machine readable patterns
    and UI elements thta anyone can put to use.
