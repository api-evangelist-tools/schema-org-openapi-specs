    on what API providers are doing when it comes to encryption, as well as keep an
    eye on the features that API service providers are offering up services, and tooling
    related to encryption.

    I've started publishing most of my research to an API Evangelist spreadsheet research
    site, which will allow me to better track, curate, tag, and tell stories around
    spreadsheets and APIs. As I do with my 60+ API research projects, I will update
    this site when I have time, publishing anything I've read, written, and companies
    I think are doing interesting things spreadsheets and APIs. I'm pretty convinced
    that spreadsheets will be another one of those bridge tools we use to connect
    where we are going with APIs, with the reality of where the everyday person is,
    just trying to get their job done.

    them in the public space. They will use APIs, and try to remain as secretive as
    possible, but like many other layers of the IoT space, their APIs will become
    their achilles heel. This is purely a monitoring channel for me, so I can keep
    a close eye on the Drone space, and try to understand what is going on.

    standardization. Yet you see some pretty interesting approaches to providing email
    infrastructure which employs, and often resemble the email standards, but put
    web APIs to work to actually do the heavy lifting.

  description: SMS owes more to the telecom industry, and mobile phones, more than
    the API space, but when it comes to reducing valuable assets to its smallest possible
    unit of value, the SMS space is well suited for evolution via the API. I think
    think that are many lessons for API providers when it comes to the SMS API space,
    and I enjoy spending time research how companies are innovating when it comes
    to the SMS, using APIs.

  description: The API Stack is an interactive, published list of companies that I'm
    watching in the API space. I regularly go through my list of companies in my CRM
    and high grade them, and promote or demote them on my monitoring list. The API
    Stack is meant to be a reflection of this research, published in a way that others
    can browse, and fork.

  description: My tracking on how APIs are being used in education across universities.
    This is one project area that overlaps with my girlfriends (@audreywatters) work
    on Hack Education. I'm looking to understand who the key insitutions are, what
    they are up to by aggregating news, analysis, companies and technology in a single
    project.
