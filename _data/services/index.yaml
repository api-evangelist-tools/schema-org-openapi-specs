    First, and foremost I tell stories, here on my blog, and in person at
    conferences, meetups, and internal or private gatherings. While I do not
    take money in exchange for writing directly about a companies products or
    services, there are many ways I approach to taking money for API
    storytelling that also allows me to sleep at night, and show my face at
    events within the industry.

    I spend a lot of time mocking APIs, and developing prototypes that can be
    used as a module for possible producting toolss, services, and other

    I assist city, state, and federal government agencies in helping think

    through the latest approaches in the context of how government works.
