  description: >-
    This is a CSV to JSON converter that I developed on top of Mr. Data
    Converter, allowing CSVs to be tranlated into JSON, and other formats, and
    back again. The  part I added was the ability to save on Github, using an
    entirely client-based solution leveraging the Github API to write JSON, CSV
    and other files to the master repository.

    This is my micro tool to help you achieve what I'd consider to be a minimum
    viable presence for your API operations. Answer any question that you can,
    and generate a report that you can consider as you are crafting your API
    management road map.

    This is a form to walk you through building your first APIs.json file index
    for your API, providing machine readable access to your API, as and the
    supporting platform operations. Just fill out the fields below, and click on
    the "Generate My APIs.json" button to generate the APIs.json.

  description: >-
    This is a quick and dirty way to build you first APIs.json file. Most likely
    you came across one of my tools that needed an APIs.json file to do
    something interesting with your OpenAPI Spec. All you need to create is add
    the URL for your OpenAPI Spec, and this will do the rest.

    This is a tool for pulling the OpenAPI Spec files that are indexed in any of
    the APIs.json indexed within the APIs.json file for this subscription repo.
    It loops through any APIs.json added to the include collection, loops
    through each APIs.json, adds a folder to the master branch for this repo,
    and publishes a copy of the APIs.json, and any OpenAPI Specs to the folder.

    I wanted a way to have a conversation around an API design with a group of
    folks. Some who are technical, but others who are not. I also wanted to use
    Github issues to help manage the ongoing conversations around the API and
    its design. I got to work building one of my micro tools to help me manage
    the process, in a way that can easily be forked and run for any project.

  description: >-
    I was pretty happy when my friend Arnaud Lauret (@arno_di_loreto) developed
    API Stylebook. I want to see his work expand and grow into someday
    containing hundreds or thousands of API design guides. To help contribute to
    his work I took the YAML core of the design topics he's aggregated and began
    developing an API design guide builder that runs 100% on Github, allowing
    anyone to fork, and use to build their own API Stylebook on top of Arnaud's
    work.

    This is a JavaScript RSS aggregator I build to pull feeds a list of URLs,
    and store the results locally in a Github repository. The project is meant
    to run 100% on Github, with no backend. The job to run the kupdate requires
    a valid Github OAuth token run via URL.
