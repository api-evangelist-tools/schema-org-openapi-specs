Usage guidelines:   Use the priceCurrency property (with ISO 4217 codes e.g.  USD ) instead of   including ambiguous symbols such as  $  in the value. Use  .  (Unicode  FULL STOP  (U+002E)) rather than  ,  to indicate a decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator. Note that both RDFa and Microdata syntax allow the use of a  content=  attribute for publishing simple machine-readable values alongside more human-friendly formatting. Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode  DIGIT ZERO  (U+0030) to  DIGIT NINE  (U+0039)) rather than superficially similiar Unicode symbols.  ",
