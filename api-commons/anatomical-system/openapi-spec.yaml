    title: Anatomical System API
    description: An anatomical system is a group of anatomical structures that work
      together to perform a certain task. Anatomical systems, such as organ systems,
      are one organizing principle of anatomy, and can includes circulatory, digestive,
      endocrine, integumentary, immune, lymphatic, muscular, nervous, reproductive,
      respiratory, skeletal, urinary, vestibular, and other systems.
