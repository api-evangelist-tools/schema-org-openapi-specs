            per gallon (mpg) or kilometers per liter (km/L).Note 1: There are unfortunately
            no standard unit codes for miles per gallon or kilometers per liter.Use
            unitText to indicate the unit of measurement, e.g. mpg or km/L.Note 2: There
            are two ways of indicating the fuel consumption, fuelConsumption (e.g. 8
            liters per 100 km) and fuelEfficiency (e.g. 30 miles per gallon). They are
            reciprocal.Note 3: Often, the absolute value is useful only when related
            to driving speed (\"at 80 km/h\") or usage pattern (\"city traffic\"). You
            can use valueReference to link the value for the fuel economy to another
            value.'
