    title: Geo Shape API
    description: The geographic shape of a place. A GeoShape can be described using
      several properties whose values are based on latitude/longitude pairs. Either
      whitespace or commas can be used to separate latitude and longitude; whitespace
      should be used when writing a list of several such points.
