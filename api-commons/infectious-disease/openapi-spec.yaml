    title: Infectious Disease API
    description: An infectious disease is a clinically evident human disease resulting
      from the presence of pathogenic microbial agents, like pathogenic viruses, pathogenic
      bacteria, fungi, protozoa, multicellular parasites, and prions. To be considered
      an infectious disease, such pathogens are known to be able to cause this disease.
