    title: Medical Guideline API
    description: 'Any recommendation made by a standard society (e.g. ACC/AHA) or consensus
      statement that denotes how to diagnose and treat a particular condition. Note:
      this type should be used to tag the actual guideline recommendation; if the guideline
      recommendation occurs in a larger scholarly article, use MedicalScholarlyArticle
      to tag the overall article, not this type. Note also: the organization making
      the recommendation should be captured in the recognizingAuthority base property
      of MedicalEntity.'
