    title: Medical Observational Study API
    description: An observational study is a type of medical study that attempts to
      infer the possible effect of a treatment through observation of a cohort of subjects
      over a period of time. In an observational study, the assignment of subjects into
      treatment groups versus control groups is outside the control of the investigator.
      This is in contrast with controlled studies, such as the randomized controlled
      trials represented by MedicalTrial, where each subject is randomly assigned to
      a treatment group or a control group before the start of the treatment.
