    description: 'A medical study is an umbrella type covering all kinds of research
      studies relating to human medicine or health, including observational studies
      and interventional trials and registries, randomized, controlled or not. When
      the specific type of study is known, use one of the extensions of this type, such
      as MedicalTrial or MedicalObservationalStudy. Also, note that this type should
      be used to mark up data that describes the study itself; to tag an article that
      publishes the results of a study, use MedicalScholarlyArticle. Note: use the code
      property of MedicalEntity to store study IDs, e.g. clinicaltrials.gov ID.'
