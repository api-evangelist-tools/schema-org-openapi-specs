          description: 'The offer price of a product, or of a price component when attached
            to PriceSpecification and its subtypes.      Usage guidelines:Use the priceCurrency
            property (with ISO 4217 codes e.g. \"USD\") instead of      including ambiguous
            symbols such as \''$\'' in the value.      Use \''.\'' (Unicode \''FULL
            STOP\'' (U+002E)) rather than \'',\'' to indicate a decimal point. Avoid
            using these symbols as a readability separator.      Note that both RDFa
            and Microdata syntax allow the use of a \"content=\" attribute for publishing
            simple machine-readable values      alongside more human-friendly formatting.      Use
            values from 0123456789 (Unicode \''DIGIT ZERO\'' (U+0030) to \''DIGIT NINE\''
            (U+0039)) rather than superficially similiar Unicode symbols.      '
