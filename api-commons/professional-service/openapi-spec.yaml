    title: Professional Service API
    description: 'Original definition: \"provider of professional services.\" The general
      ProfessionalService type for local businesses was deprecated due to confusion
      with Service. For reference, the types that it included were: Dentist, AccountingService,
      Attorney, Notary, as well as types for several kinds of HomeAndConstructionBusiness:
      Electrician, GeneralContractor, HousePainter, Locksmith, Plumber, RoofingContractor.
      LegalService was introduced as a more inclusive supertype of Attorney. '
