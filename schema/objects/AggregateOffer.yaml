  price:

      property (with ISO 4217 codes e.g.  USD ) instead of   including ambiguous symbols
      such as  $  in the value. Use  .  (Unicode  FULL STOP  (U+002E)) rather than  ,  to
      indicate a decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.
      Note that both RDFa and Microdata syntax allow the use of a  content=  attribute
      for publishing simple machine-readable values alongside more human-friendly
      formatting. Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode  DIGIT ZERO  (U+0030) to  DIGIT
      NINE  (U+0039)) rather than superficially similiar Unicode symbols.  '
