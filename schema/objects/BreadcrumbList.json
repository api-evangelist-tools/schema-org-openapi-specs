    "description": "A BreadcrumbList is an ItemList consisting of a chain of linked Web pages, typically described using at least their URL and their name, and typically ending with the current page.  The position property is used to reconstruct the order of the items in a BreadcrumbList The convention is that a breadcrumb list has an itemListOrder of ItemListOrderAscending (lower values listed first), and that the first items in this list correspond to the  top  or beginning of the breadcrumb trail, e.g. with a site or section homepage. The specific values of  position  are not assigned meaning for a BreadcrumbList, but they should be integers, e.g. beginning with  1  for the first item in the list.",

            "description": "For itemListElement values, you can use simple strings (e.g.  Peter ,  Paul ,  Mary ), existing entities, or use ListItem.  Text values are best if the elements in the list are plain strings. Existing entities are best for a simple, unordered list of existing things in your data. ListItem is used with ordered lists when you want to provide additional context about the element in that list or when the same item might be in different places in different lists.  Note: The order of elements in your mark-up is not sufficient for indicating the order or elements.  Use ListItem with a  position  property in such cases.",
