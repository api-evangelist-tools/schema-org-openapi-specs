  itemListElement:
    description: 'For itemListElement values, you can use simple strings (e.g.  Peter
      ,  Paul ,  Mary ), existing entities, or use ListItem.  Text values are best
      if the elements in the list are plain strings. Existing entities are best for
      a simple, unordered list of existing things in your data. ListItem is used with
      ordered lists when you want to provide additional context about the element
      in that list or when the same item might be in different places in different
      lists.  Note: The order of elements in your mark-up is not sufficient for indicating
      the order or elements.  Use ListItem with a  position  property in such cases.'

      not fully describe all items in a list (e.g., multi-page pagination); in such
      cases, the numberOfItems would be for the entire list.
