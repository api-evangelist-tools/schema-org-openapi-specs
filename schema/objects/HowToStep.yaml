schema: http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#
description: A step in the instructions for how to achieve a result. It is an ordered
  list with HowToDirection and/or HowToTip items.
properties:
  itemListElement:
    description: 'For itemListElement values, you can use simple strings (e.g.  Peter
      ,  Paul ,  Mary ), existing entities, or use ListItem.  Text values are best
      if the elements in the list are plain strings. Existing entities are best for
      a simple, unordered list of existing things in your data. ListItem is used with
      ordered lists when you want to provide additional context about the element
      in that list or when the same item might be in different places in different
      lists.  Note: The order of elements in your mark-up is not sufficient for indicating
      the order or elements.  Use ListItem with a  position  property in such cases.'
    schema:
      $ref: 'http://schema.org.apievangelist.com/schema/objects/ListItem'
  itemListOrder:
    description: Type of ordering (e.g. Ascending, Descending, Unordered).
    type: string
  numberOfItems:
    description: The number of items in an ItemList. Note that some descriptions might
      not fully describe all items in a list (e.g., multi-page pagination); in such
      cases, the numberOfItems would be for the entire list.

      s identity. E.g. the URL of the item s Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official

  additionalType:
    description: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific
      types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship
      between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better
      to use the native RDFa syntax - the  typeof  attribute - for multiple types.
      Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular
      those defined externally.
