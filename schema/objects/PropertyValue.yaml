$id: http://schema.org.apievangelist.com/schema/objects/PropertyValue.yaml
schema: http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#
description: A property-value pair, e.g. representing a feature of a product or place.
  Use the  name  property for the name of the property. If there is an additional
  human-readable version of the value, put that into the  description  property.  Always
  use specific schema.org properties when a) they exist and b) you can populate them.
  Using PropertyValue as a substitute will typically not trigger the same effect as
  using the original, specific property.
properties:
  unitCode:
    description: The unit of measurement given using the UN/CEFACT Common Code (3
      characters) or a URL. Other codes than the UN/CEFACT Common Code may be used
      with a prefix followed by a colon.

  minValue:
    description: The lower value of some characteristic or property.
    type: number

  propertyID:
    description: A commonly used identifier for the characteristic represented by
      the property, e.g. a manufacturer or a standard code for a property. propertyID
      can be (1) a prefixed string, mainly meant to be used with standards for product
      properties; (2) a site-specific, non-prefixed string (e.g. the primary key of
      the property or the vendor-specific id of the property), or (3) a URL indicating
      the type of the property, either pointing to an external vocabulary, or a Web
      resource that describes the property (e.g. a glossary entry). Standards bodies
      should promote a standard prefix for the identifiers of properties from their
      standards.

  additionalType:
    description: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific
      types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship
      between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better
      to use the native RDFa syntax - the  typeof  attribute - for multiple types.
      Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular
      those defined externally.
